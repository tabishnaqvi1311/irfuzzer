# AC Remote

This app helps you find the IR code for your air conditioner. It cycles through thousands of possible codes to find the one that controls your AC unit.

## How to Use

1.  **Install the app.** You'll need an Android device with a built-in IR blaster.
2.  **Point your device at your AC.**
3.  **Tap "Start Scan".** The app will send a new code every 2 seconds.
4.  **When your AC beeps or turns on/off, tap "Stop Scan".**
5.  **Tap "Test Last Code"** to send the same code again and confirm it works.

**Note:** This app only works on phones with an IR blaster. Most modern phones do not have this feature.
